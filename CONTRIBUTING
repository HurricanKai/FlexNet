## Coding conventions
These are some Simple guidelines, to make your Code more uniform, and easy to Read.

- We intend 4 Spaces. 
- private Fields are Prefixed with an Underscore (`_`)
- We use camelCase for private Fields, and PascalCase for Classes, Methods, Properties.
- Else try to fit into exsisting Code Style, I shurely have missed something here.
