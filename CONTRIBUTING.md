## Testing
Include unit tests with your commits.

## Submitting changes
Submit a PR, and list the changes that you've made.

## Coding conventions
These are some simple guidelines, to make your code more uniform, and easy to read:

- Indent with 4 Spaces. 
- Private fields are prefixed with an underscore (`_`)
- Use camelCase for private fields, and PascalCase for classes, methods, & properties.
- Otherwise, try to fit into exsisting code style (I've probably missed something here).
